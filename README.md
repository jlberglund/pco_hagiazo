# README

This is a developing project for local churches using Planning Center Online, especially the People app. The purpose is to easily clean/format data in Planning Center. This includes:

* Cleaning names (i.e. with proper casing)
* Cleaning addresses with SmartyStreets
* Formatting phone numbers to a common format

Besides this, it'd be interesting to get some insight on Planning Center data, looking for patterns and pointing out potential data entry issues.

## Getting Started

We'll need to include details on getting started with the app later.
